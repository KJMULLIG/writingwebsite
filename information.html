    <p>This is a website designed to faciliate collaborative creative writing. People will be periodically shuffled in a random order and tasked to write the next chapter.</p>
    <p>Even though the only people who are likely to come across this website are the writers themselves, bear in mind that all submissions are public. Anyone with the link to the website can read what you have written. Previous entries of the current story and completed stories can be read.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <p>There are no restrictions on what or how to write. However, you should probably write an appropriate amount--somewhere between a paragraph and a entire novel. Avoid making drastic changes to the story, such as revealing all of the previous events were a dream.</p>
    <p>Anyone is permitted to conclude the story. Try to give other people the opporunity to contribute before writing a conclusion. If you have accidentally turned off submissions, contact the site administrator.</p>
    <p>Submitted text can not be edited after the fact.</p>
    <p>Inform the group after submitting a chapter. This website is unable to notify people automatically.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to write in a seperate word processor as unsubmitted work is not saved. Submitted text can not be stylized text in bold or italics.</p>
    <p>Contact the site administrator if you would like to skip your turn.</p>

    <h3>User Creation</h3>
    <p>You can create an account <a href="signup.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Please make usernames in all lowercase with no spaces. Absolutely do not use a password you have used on other sites; I have no idea how data security works and an LLM did most of the work. Both usernames and passwords are case-sensitive. If you would like to change your username or password, contact the site administrator.</p>
